# Summary

This RFC proposes the introduction of a official convention to specify the targets of an
application.

### Motivation

Javascript and the platforms it runs on are moving targets. NodeJS and browsers release new
versions every few weeks. Browsers auto update and each update brings new language features
and APIs.

Developers need an easy way to express intention that abstracts them from the ever-changing
landscape of versions and feature matrices, so this RFC proposes to introduce a universal
configuration option to let developers express they intended targets

This configuration should be easily available to addons, but this RFC doesn't impose
any mandatory behavior on addons. All addons that want to get customize their behavior
depending on the target platforms will have a single source of truth to get that
information but it's up to them to do it.

The advantage of having a single source of truth for the targets compared to having several
configurations, each one with its own `targets` is mostly for better ergonomics and across-the-board
consistency.

Addons that would benefit from this conventions are `babel-preset-env`, `autoprefixer`,
`stylelint` and `eslint` (vÃ­a `eslint-plugin-compat`), but not only those. Even Ember itself could,
once converted into an addon, take advantage of that to avoid polyfilling or even taking
advantage of some DOM API (`node.classList`?) deep in Glimmer's internals.

### Detailed implementation


### Browser support

What seems to be the most popular tool and the state of the art on this is the [browserlist](https://github.com/ai/browserslist)
npm package.

That package is the one behind `babel-preset-env`, `autoprefixer` and others, and uses the data from
[Can I Use](http://caniuse.com/) for knowing the JS, CSS and other APIs available on every browser.

The syntax is also pretty flexible as it allows all sort of complex queries like `Firefox >= 20`,
`>2.5% in CA` (browsers with a market share over 2.5% in Canada) and logical combinations.

Using this syntax would allow us to integrate easily with other tools.

Example usage:

```js
var app = new EmberApp(defaults, {
  targets: {
    browsers: ['>2%', 'last 3 iOS versions', 'not ie <= 8']
  }
});
```

This configuration must be made available to addons. It's up to the addons to use it.
I suggest to make it available in `app.targets`

```js
module.exports = {
  name: 'ember-data',

  included(app) {
    this._super.included.apply(this, arguments);

    console.log(app.targets.browsers); // ['>2%', 'last 3 iOS versions', 'not ie <= 8']
  }
};
```

### Node support

In addition to browsers, Ember apps can run in node using ember-fastboot. If that is the
case, we need to cover node as a target, but it deserves a different entry on `targets.node`.

The syntax for for this configuration option is even simpler, since apps will only run in a single
version of node and developers are in control of it, so the only thing users must specify is the
minimum supported version of node.

Example usage:

```js
var app = new EmberApp(defaults, {
  targets: {
    browsers: ['>2%', 'last 3 iOS versions', 'not ie <= 8'],
    node: "6"
  }
});
```

This configuration is also available to addons in `app.targets.node`;

```js
module.exports = {
  name: 'ember-data',

  included(app) {
    this._super.included.apply(this, arguments);

    console.log(app.targets.node); // "6"
  }
};
```

If this property is not provided, addons can assume that this app does not target node.

# How We Teach This

This is a new concept in Ember CLI, so guides will have to be updated to explain this
concept. The good part is that this new concept can help enforcing with tools a task were
traditionally enforced only with peer reviews.

To ease the transition Ember CLI can also, in the absence of a specific value provided by the user,
default to a predefined matrix of browsers that matches the browsers officially supported by the framework.

# Drawbacks

While this RFC standardizes a concept that will open the door to better and more comprehensive tooling,
it makes us choose one syntax (the one used by [browserlist](https://github.com/ai/browserslist)) over
any other perhaps superior choice that may exist or appear in the future.

# Alternatives

Let every addon that wants to deal with targets to have a `targets`-like option in its configuration
instead of standardizing a single configuration option, which effectively leaves things as they are
right now.

Example:

```
var app = new EmberApp(defaults, {
  'ember-cli-autoprefixer': {
    browsers: ...
  },
  'ember-cli-babel': {
    targets: ...
  },
  'ember-cli-eslint': {
    engines: ...
  },
  ...
});
```

# Unresolved questions

The proposed syntax for node only supports a single version of node. Is it reasonable to
make this property an array of versions? P.e. `["4.4", "6", "7"]`
