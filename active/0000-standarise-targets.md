# Summary

This RFC proposes the introduction of a official convention to specify the targets of an
application.

# Motivation

Javascript and the platforms it runs on are moving targets. NodeJS and browsers release new
versions every few weeks. Browsers auto update and each update brings new language features
and APIs.

Developers need an easy way to express intention that abstracts them from the ever-changing
landscape of versions and feature matrices, so this RFC proposes to introduce a universal
configuration option to let developers express their intended targets

This configuration should be easily available to addons, but this RFC doesn't impose
any mandatory behavior on addons. All addons that want to customize their behavior
depending on the target platforms will have a single source of truth to get that
information but it's up to them how to use it.

The advantage of having a single source of truth for the targets compared to configure this
on a per-addon basis like we do today is mostly for better ergonomics and across-the-board
consistency.

Addons that would benefit from this conventions are `babel-preset-env`, `autoprefixer`,
`stylelint` and `eslint` (vÃ­a `eslint-plugin-compat`), but not only those. Even Ember itself could,
once converted into an addon, take advantage of that to avoid polyfilling or even taking
advantage of some DOM API (`node.classList`?) deep in Glimmer's internals.

# Detailed design

What seems to be the most popular tool and the state of the art on this is the [browserlist](https://github.com/ai/browserslist)
npm package.

That package is the one behind `babel-preset-env`, `autoprefixer` and others, and uses the data from
[Can I Use](http://caniuse.com/) for knowing the JS, CSS and other APIs available on every browser.

The syntax is also pretty flexible as it allows all sort of complex queries like `Firefox >= 20`,
`>2.5% in CA` (browsers with a market share over 2.5% in Canada) and logical combinations.

Using this syntax would allow us to integrate easily with other tools.

This configuration must be made available to addons. It's up to the addons to use honor it.

### Browser support

The configution of target browsers must in a file that allows javascript execution and exports an object
with the configuration. Putting the configuration in a file with javascript execution is important because
allows us to have different config in development and production without having to different keys per 
environment or any other environment variable.

One option is the `.ember-cli` file. A new dedicated file under `/config` could also 
be a good option, much like `config/ember-try.js`.

To addons this list of target browsers will be available in `this.project.targets.browsers`. E.g:

```js
module.exports = {
  name: 'ember-data',

  included(app) {
    this._super.included.apply(this, arguments);

    console.log(this.project.targets.browsers); // ['>2%', 'last 3 iOS versions', 'not ie <= 8']
  }
};
```

### Node support

In addition to browsers, Ember apps can run in node using ember-fastboot, but this is already covered implicitly 
by the `engines` property in the package.json of the app (or the host app in the case of engines), so no new syntax needed
for defining the support.

The minimum supported version of node will be available in `this.project.targets.node`. 

```js
module.exports = {
  name: 'ember-data',

  included(app) {
    this._super.included.apply(this, arguments);

    console.log(this.project.targets.node); // '>= 4'
  }
};
```

# How We Teach This

This is a new concept in Ember CLI, so guides will have to be updated to explain this
concept. The good part is that this new concept can help enforcing with tools a task were
traditionally enforced only with peer reviews.

To ease the transition Ember CLI can also, in the absence of a specific value provided by the user,
default to a predefined matrix of browsers that matches the browsers officially supported by the framework.

As of today, the supported browser list for Ember.js, according to the platforms we test in saucelabs, is:

`['IE9', 'Chrome current', 'Safari current', 'Firefox current']`

There is no mention to IOS/Android, so this must be validated still.

# Drawbacks

While this RFC standardizes a concept that will open the door to better and more comprehensive tooling,
it makes us choose one syntax (the one used by [browserlist](https://github.com/ai/browserslist)) over
any other perhaps superior choice that may exist or appear in the future.

# Alternatives

Let every addon that wants to deal with targets to have a `targets`-like option in its configuration
instead of standardizing a single configuration option, which effectively leaves things as they are
right now.

Example:

```
var app = new EmberApp(defaults, {
  'ember-cli-autoprefixer': {
    browsers: ...
  },
  'ember-cli-babel': {
    targets: ...
  },
  'ember-cli-eslint': {
    engines: ...
  },
  ...
});
```

# Unresolved questions

The proposed syntax for node only supports a single version of node. Is it reasonable to
make this property an array of versions? P.e. `["4.4", "6", "7"]`
